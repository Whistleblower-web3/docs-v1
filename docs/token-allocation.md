### Test Token WTRC

In the current testnet, Truth Coin (WTRC) is a token used for project testing, covering platform transactions, governance, and incentives. Test tokens do not possess any real-world value.

### Token Allocation Plan

> We have not yet launched a specific token allocation plan, but we will launch a reasonable token allocation plan based on the development of the project.
