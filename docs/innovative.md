### Innovation: Redefining the Anchor of "Value"

WikiTruth is not another DeFi protocol, nor is it an ordinary NFT marketplace. We are pioneering a new paradigm: **Assetizing "Social Truth" and enabling its monetization capabilities.**

#### 1. Innovation at the Asset Level: Truth as an Asset

In traditional Web3, assets are usually tokens or artworks. WikiTruth defines **"Criminal Evidence"** and **"Social Truth"** as a high-liquidity crypto asset (Truth Box) for the first time.

- **From "Virtual" to "Real"**: Behind every Truth Box corresponds to key information in the real world that may change the situation. Its value does not come from sentiment, but from the rigid demand for truth in the real world.
- **Ownership Confirmation**: Using blockchain technology, we allow whistleblowers to truly own the ownership and disposal rights of evidence, rather than just being a "Deep Throat" who could be silenced at any time.

#### 2. Innovation in Economic Model: Delayed Disclosure Premium

This is WikiTruth's most disruptive design. We are not simply selling evidence, but designing a **"Time Game"**.

- **Taxing Evil**: Want to cover up the truth? Sure, please pay. We allow buyers (usually stakeholders) to purchase the right to delay disclosure by paying time fees.
- **Unsustainable Lies**: The price increases **exponentially** over time. This means that the cost of covering up the truth will eventually exceed the buyer's ability to pay.
- **Inevitable Disclosure**: This mechanism mathematically destines that: **All truth will eventually see the light of day, it's just a matter of time.** In this process, the vast majority of rewards flow to the provider of justice (the whistleblower).

#### 3. Innovation in Technology Fusion: Privacy Computing + Blockchain

We solve the natural contradiction between blockchain's "open transparency" and evidence's "need for confidentiality".

- **Oasis Sapphire TEE**: Using a Trusted Execution Environment to achieve "on-chain data invisibility, but logic execution". The contract can verify if the buyer has paid, but the buyer can only see the decryption key after paying.
- **Balance between Decentralization and Privacy**: We don't need a centralized server to keep evidence (preventing it from being bombed or seized), nor do we need to fully disclose evidence (preventing whistleblowers from losing leverage as soon as they publish).

### New Possibilities Brought

The emergence of WikiTruth opens the door to **"Justice-as-a-Service" (JaaS)**.

#### 1. Economic Liberation of Whistleblowers
In the past, whistleblowers often faced the risk of ruined reputations and lost jobs. WikiTruth provides them with a path to **"Anonymous Monetization"**. When justice is not just a moral impulse but a considerable income, we believe there will be a massive influx of truth into the market.

#### 2. Changes in Judicial Games
For law enforcement agencies, key evidence can be obtained at a very low cost by following WikiTruth's "Bounty Market" or "Trading Market". For criminals, WikiTruth will become the Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads—**you never know when your accomplices will turn you into a Truth Box for WTRC.**

#### 3. The Ultimate Form of Prediction Markets
Traditional prediction markets (like Polymarket) bet on outcomes; WikiTruth trades **the conspiracy inside information that determines the outcome**. This is a dimensional upgrade of the information disclosure mechanism.

WikiTruth is proving: **Web3 can not only be used to speculate on air, but also to purify the air.**
