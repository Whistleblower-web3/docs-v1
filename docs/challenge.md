### Challenges & Risks

The "crime evidence economy" that WikiTruth attempts to build is a bold reconstruction of the existing social governance model. Redefining the way justice is obtained with code inevitably faces huge challenges from ethics, law, technology, and human nature itself. Facing these risks directly is the only way for WikiTruth to mature.

### 1. Ethical Dilemma: Monetization of Justice or Tool for Extortion?

This is the sharpest social ethical question facing WikiTruth.

- **Challenge**: The outside world may question whether the platform provides a convenient tool for "extortion"—monetizing criminal evidence and allowing buyers to delay the disclosure of the truth by paying time fees. Has this become an accomplice to evil?
- **Our Response**:
    - **Lesser of Two Evils**: Private extortion is often accompanied by indefinite concealment and physical threats to whistleblowers. WikiTruth makes this process "transparent" and "programmatic".
    - **Inevitability of Truth**: The **"Increasing Time Fee"** mechanism is the core design. The exponential growth of fees will eventually exceed the criminal's ability to pay, and the truth cannot be hidden forever. We levy a "tax on time" on evil and feed the funds back to the defenders of justice.
    - **Process is Punishment**: The fear of making criminals pay a high price continuously is a deterrent in itself.
    - **Punishing Evil and Promoting Good**: WikiTruth is consistent with police bounty evidence—rewarding truth providers, punishing bad guys, and curbing crime.

### 2. The "Oracle" Problem: Verification of Evidence Authenticity

Blockchain can ensure data immutability, but it cannot guarantee the authenticity of the source of on-chain data (Garbage In, Garbage Out).

- **Challenge**: Someone may use AI deepfake technology (Deepfake) to generate false evidence for blackmail, or maliciously upload irrelevant information, damaging the platform's credibility.
- **Response Mechanism**:
    - **Game Cost**: Minting a Truth Box requires paying gas fees, and the buyer (criminal) is the best verifier. If the evidence is fake, the buyer can apply for a refund.
    - **DAO Arbitration & Reputation System**: Introducing "Blacklist" and "Challenge Period" mechanisms, adjudicating disputes through community voting and decentralized courts, and blacklisting malicious actors.
    - **Technical Assistance**: Introducing AI forgery detection models in the future to raise the threshold for counterfeiting.

### 3. Regulatory Storm & Legal Boundaries

As a platform involving sensitive data and capital flows, WikiTruth operates in a legal gray area globally.

- **Challenge**:
    - **Data Compliance**: Different countries have different legal definitions for data privacy, defamation, and extortion, and government agencies may block it.
    - **Jurisdictional Conflict**: Decentralization invalidates traditional territorial jurisdiction and may also invite stronger technical blockades.
- **Response Mechanism**:
    - **Complete Decentralization**: The DAO governance structure means the platform has no single legal entity responsible, and the code is deployed on censorship-resistant blockchain networks, possessing BitTorrent-like survivability.
    - **Privacy Isolation**: Utilizing Oasis Sapphire's privacy features, node validators cannot know the specific data content being processed, avoiding some joint legal liability at the technical level.
    - **Compliance Exploration**: Exploring compliance boundaries through legal advisory funds and preparing distributed node migration plans for extreme situations.

### 4. Technical Barriers & Trust Threshold

- **Challenge**:
    - **Security of Privacy Computing**: WikiTruth relies on the security of TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), which is based on Intel's official hardware security technology. Once the underlying hardware has vulnerabilities, it may lead to confidential data leakage.
    - **User Threshold**: For non-Web3 users, managing private keys, purchasing tokens, and understanding Gas fees are complex operations that hinder the inflow of real evidence.
- **Response Mechanism**:
    - **Multiple Encryption Defense Lines**: In addition to TEE, we plan to cooperate with the Oasis team and other privacy technology teams to expand to Zero-Knowledge Proof technology to achieve anti-quantum attack capabilities.
    - **Account Abstraction**: Integrating technologies like EIP-4337 in the future to support social login and Gas-less interaction, allowing Web2 users to use Web3 infrastructure seamlessly.

### 5. Dark Forest Effect

- **Challenge**: Criminal forces may locate whistleblowers through traffic analysis, social engineering, and other means. Although anonymous on-chain, off-chain metadata (such as IP addresses, operation time habits) may expose identities.
- **Response Mechanism**:
    - **Mandatory Privacy Routing**: The website does not acquire any user-side data and guides users to use decentralized websites.
    - **EIP-712 Proxy Interaction**: Cutting off the direct association between user wallets and contracts, obfuscating transaction links through relays.
    - **Security Education**: Providing a detailed "Security Operation Manual" to improve users' counter-reconnaissance awareness.

### Conclusion

WikiTruth is not a perfect utopia, but an experiment walking on the edge of chaos and order. We know the road ahead is full of thorns, but we firmly believe: **Pricing truth is the only way to break the spiral of silence.** Even if faced with many risks, as long as we can let the light shine into even one dark corner, all these efforts will be meaningful.
