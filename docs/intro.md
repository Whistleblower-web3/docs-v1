# Welcome to WikiTruth Documentation

**WikiTruth** is the world's first **Decentralized Whistleblower Incentive and Crime Evidence Marketplace**, a Web3 digital upgrade based on the SEC Whistleblower Program.

Through WikiTruth, whistleblowers can transform **Risk Truth** into on-chain assets (Truth Box), monetize them through a trading marketplace, and receive economic rewards, thereby stimulating more enthusiasm for participating in acts of justice.
