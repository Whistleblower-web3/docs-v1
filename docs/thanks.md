### Acknowledgments

> "Truth does not disappear because no one listens, and justice does not stop because the road is rough."

Thank you to all truth providers, partners, investors, and community users who have contributed to WikiTruth. It is because of your support and trust that WikiTruth can continue to move forward and promote the cause of social justice.

We especially want to thank those who bravely stood up for the truth—whether you use WikiTruth or not, you are warriors lighting torches in the dark. Every revelation, every shout, adds a brick to the light of this world.

### Salute to Web3: The Era of Redefining Trust

The rise of Web3 is not just a technological leap, but a fundamental reconstruction of traditional power structures.

In the Web2 era, we were forced to entrust trust to a few giants and accept their rules and censorship. Web3 breaks this shackle—**Code is Law, Truth is Justice**. It provides everyone with equal opportunities to participate and choose independently, returning power truly to the individual.

**Decentralization is not just a technical architecture, but a value concept.** It allows us to collaborate and create in an environment that does not require trusting third parties, allowing global wisdom and courage to flow freely.

WikiTruth is a practitioner of this concept. We believe that when technology meets justice, when code combines with conscience, we can build a fairer, more transparent, and immutable world.

### Building the Future Together

Thank you Web3 for the infinite possibilities provided to us. In this new era, everyone can be a promoter of change:

- **Developers** weaving the web of justice with code
- **Investors** supporting valuable innovation with capital
- **Users** validating the power of decentralization with participation
- **Whistleblowers** illuminating dark corners with courage

We stand at a turning point in history. Let us move forward together, guarding truth with the power of technology, and reshaping trust with the concept of blockchain decentralization.
