### Market Overview

**WikiTruth** is a **Decentralized Whistleblower Incentive and Crime Evidence Marketplace** built on **Oasis Sapphire** (an EVM-compatible public chain with TEE privacy computing capabilities).

We are committed to building a truth monetization network that **does not rely on moral consciousness, but on mathematics and code**. By transforming **"Risk Truth"** into digital assets, we solve the problems of trust collapse and lack of incentives in traditional channels.

### Natural Advantages of Web3

#### 1. Code is Law

Immutable smart contracts remove the possibility of human intervention and strictly execute according to established logic.

#### 2. Privacy Computing Shield

Based on **Oasis Sapphire**'s TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) and Intel SGX, providing hardware-level security protection.

#### 3. Distributed Storage (Permaweb)

Integrating IPFS and Arweave to shred and store evidence files. This eliminates the risk of single-point malice or failure.

### Privacy and Security

#### 1. On-chain Anonymity

Users interact only through relay proxies (EIP-712 signatures), achieving on-chain untraceability.

#### 2. AES + EDCH Symmetric Encryption

AES-256 remains the most secure and insurmountable algorithm currently, with strong quantum resistance.

### Unique Mechanisms of WikiTruth

#### 1. Market-Based Incentives

Transforming evidence into circulating on-chain assets, realizing value and returns through dynamic market games and trading.

#### 2. Time-Lock Mechanism

In WikiTruth, secrecy is not permanent. Once the expiration time is reached, it will be automatically published.

#### 3. Delayed Disclosure Premium

Stakeholders pay fees to extend the time lock of the Truth Box. We call this fee the **Delayed Disclosure Premium**.

#### 4. Inevitable Public Disclosure

Delay fees will grow exponentially, eventually becoming unaffordable, leading to the inevitable disclosure of the truth.

### Ecological Philosophy

WikiTruth's ecological cycle is built on the philosophy that **truth determines economic returns, and economic returns incentivize more truth**:

<!-- 1. **Mint**: Whistleblowers encrypt and upload Risk Truth, generating a "Truth Box".
2. **Circulation**: The Truth Box itself can be traded as an asset, generating revenue for the whistleblower.
3. **Delay Game**: Buyers can choose to pay the **Delayed Disclosure Premium** to temporarily delay publication.
4. **Reveal**: If payment is not made in time, the Truth Box will be opened, keys released, and the truth revealed. -->
