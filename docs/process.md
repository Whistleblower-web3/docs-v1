### Core Operational Process

WikiTruth transforms the traditional offline fact disclosure process into an on-chain quantifiable **value game process** through smart contracts.

In the protocol operation, three core roles are involved: **Whistleblower (Minter)**, **Buyer**, and **Helpers: Seller/Completer**.

#### 1. Truth Assetization

- **Upload**: Upload evidence files and metadata to IPFS/Arweave.
- **Mint**: Mint a **Truth Box** in the smart contract.

#### 2. Market Circulation

- **Sell/Auction**: The Minter can initiate a sale or auction within the protection period.
- **Help Sell**: If the time limit is exceeded, anyone can assist in selling and become a Seller.

#### 3. Delivery and Verification

- **Purchase**: After the Buyer pays, access rights are granted.
- **Inspection Period**: The Buyer can choose to request a refund or complete the order;
- **Help Complete**: If the time limit is exceeded, anyone can assist in completing the order and become a Completer.

#### 4. Delayed Disclosure & Game

- **Delaying Status**: After the transaction is completed, the Box enters the "Delaying" status.
- **Delayed Fee**: The Buyer needs to pay the **Delayed Fee** regularly.
- **Final Disclosure**: If the Buyer stops paying the delayed fee, the Box will automatically enter the "Published" status, the truth will be disclosed, fulfilling its final social value realization.
