### Society & Human Nature: Why is Justice Silent?

![User Groups](/docs/user-group.svg)

Human society's desire for justice is eternal, yet when individuals face powerful injustice or criminal forces, they often fall into collective silence. WikiTruth deeply understands the complex human nature behind this.

1. **Tear between Moral Conscience and Fear**: Insiders yearn for justice but are bound by fear—fear of retaliation, fear of loss, fear of the unknown. The conflict between morality and realistic interests is the first high wall preventing the truth from surfacing.
2. **Lack of Anonymity and Security Guarantees**: Under centralized power systems, whistleblower identity information is easily leaked, leading to retaliation. A truly secure, anonymous, and technically untraceable channel is a necessary prerequisite for releasing conscience.
3. **Interest Returns and Action Incentives**: Justice actions driven purely by morality are difficult to sustain. When providing truth yields reasonable returns, acts of justice will transform from individual sacrifice into sustainable social momentum.
4. **Irreversible Energy of Truth**: Truth is the terminator of all lies. Once key criminal facts are made public, no matter how powerful the authority, its foundation will be shaken.
5. **Bridging the Gap between Justice and Reality**: Most people yearn for justice but are often suppressed by reality. WikiTruth provides a safe channel and economic support for unleashing courage for those who "have the will but not the strength".

### The Criminal's Mindset: The Spiral of Fear and Cost

WikiTruth deeply perceives the psychological weaknesses of criminals, turning their fear into bargaining chips for upholding justice.

1. **Absolute Fear of Exposure**: What criminals fear most is not the law itself, but the complete exposure of the truth—meaning the collapse of social status, wealth, and reputation, followed by legal sanctions and public opinion trials.
2. **Delayed Disclosure Cost**: To maintain the "illusion", criminals may be willing to pay a high price to delay the disclosure of the truth. WikiTruth's "Increasing Time Fee" mechanism accurately captures this psychology, making covering up the truth an unsustainable economic black hole.
3. **Shattering of Fluke Mentality**: Criminals always think the truth can be buried forever. But the inevitable disclosure mechanism of WikiTruth will completely shatter this fluke.
4. **Disintegration of Internal Trust**: Criminal gangs are filled with distrust internally. WikiTruth becomes a sword hanging over all accomplices' heads—you never know who will turn you into a Truth Box for a huge reward, thus detonating internal games.
5. **Deterrence of Unknown Authenticity**: Even if unsure about the authenticity of the evidence in the Truth Box, "What if it's true?" This uncertainty is enough to make criminals restless, prompting them to pay the price to verify authenticity.

WikiTruth leverages the scales of justice with the power of code by precisely anchoring and amplifying these complex human natures and social games.
