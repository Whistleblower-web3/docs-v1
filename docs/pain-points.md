### Industry Status

> When the cost of maintaining the truth is higher than the cost of covering up lies, the trust system begins to crumble.

![Justice vs Evil](/docs/good-bad.jpg)

Although we have established complex judicial systems to punish evil and promote good, in reality, power, money, and networks of interest erode the foundations of this system like vines. Too many truths are obscured, evidence disappears, is tampered with, or bought out. Existing regulatory and verification systems face severe challenges. Whether it is the protection of individual rights or the disclosure of key facts, they are often hindered by **conflicts of interest**, **opaque processes**, and **technological lag**.

### Core Pain Points Analysis

#### 1. Centralized Trust Failure

Traditional auditing and regulation rely heavily on centralized institutions. However, centralization implies single-point risks:

- **Human Intervention**: Auditors may filter or distort key information due to negligence, bias, or corruption.
- **Black Box Operations**: The public cannot verify the decision-making process and is forced to accept the final result, leading to a decline in public credibility year by year.

#### 2. High Risk of Disclosure

Although legal frameworks like the SEC Whistleblower Program exist globally, "whistleblowers" still face huge real-world threats:

- **Identity Exposure**: Traditional channels struggle to technically guarantee absolute anonymity; IP addresses, metadata, or internal leaks can expose identities.
- **Risk of Retaliation**: Once identities are leaked, disclosers often face career blacklisting, legal harassment, and even threats to personal safety.
  This asymmetric risk causes a vast amount of critical truth to be buried forever.

#### 3. Fragile Chain of Custody

In the Web2 era, the storage of electronic evidence is extremely fragile:

- **Easy to Tamper**: Database logs can be modified by administrators, and files can be replaced.
- **Easy to Destroy**: Physical damage to servers, hacker attacks, or service provider shutdowns can cause evidence to disappear forever.
- **Questionable Legal Validity**: Lacking immutable timestamps and proofs of integrity, electronic evidence is often challenged for authenticity in court.

#### 4. Cross-Border Inefficiency

When involving transnational crimes or global events, the fragmentation of jurisdictions prevents the effective flow of data:

- **Legal Barriers**: Data privacy laws and forensic procedures vary hugely across different countries.
- **Cumbersome Processes**: Applying for Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT) through diplomatic channels often takes months or even years, severely lagging behind the best window for handling events.

#### 5. Incentive Asymmetry

Current social mechanisms often lead to "bad money driving out good":

- **Low Cost of Evil**: Covering up the truth often only requires paying limited public relations fees or fines.
- **High Cost of Rights Protection**: The party revealing the truth must bear huge social pressure, legal fees, and potential economic losses alone.
- **Lack of Positive Feedback**: Apart from moral praise, society lacks an automated mechanism to compensate for the costs of acts of justice.

#### 6. Uncertainty of Reward

- **Opaque Returns**: Returns from traditional channels often rely on "insider" information and lack transparency.
- **Unpredictable Returns**: Even through legal channels, returns are difficult to predict accurately and are often greatly discounted due to the uncertainty of judicial procedures.
- **Long Return Cycle**: It often takes months or even years from revealing the truth to receiving a reward.

_These systemic defects indicate that relying solely on existing institutional patches cannot solve the fundamental problem. We need a new, technology-driven paradigm to break this deadlock._
