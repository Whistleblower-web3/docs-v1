# Reality & Legal Basis

WikiTruth is not built outside the law, but is a digital extension of traditional judicial procedures in the Web3 era. Our core logic is derived from mature legal frameworks (such as the SEC and CFTC Whistleblower Programs).

## 1. Legal Basis: The Compliance Digital Cornerstone

WikiTruth's design is deeply inspired by the **US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Whistleblower Program** and upgrades its practical logic in a decentralized manner. We position ourselves as **"Decentralized RegTech Infrastructure"**.

### Core Legal Pillars

WikiTruth's operating model finds a solid jurisprudential basis in the following key legal provisions:

#### A. Core Authorization Act (Dodd-Frank Act Section 922)

> _Legal Cornerstone: Established the legality of whistleblower rewards._

Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is the legal basis for the SEC Whistleblower Program. The act explicitly authorizes the SEC to establish a program to pay awards to whistleblowers who provide **Original Information** that leads to successful enforcement actions.
We digitize this "reward promise" into the automatic execution logic of on-chain smart contracts.

#### B. Reward Mechanism (15 U.S.C. § 78u-6 / Exchange Act Section 21F)

> _Economic Model: Clarified the proportion of value return._

Title 15 U.S.C. § 78u-6 requires the SEC to pay awards to eligible whistleblowers ranging from **10% to 30%** of the total monetary sanctions collected.
This provides a real-world value anchor for our token economic model. WikiTruth realizes this potential "future claim" in advance through market games, solving the problem of long return cycles (several years) in traditional channels.

#### C. Privacy Protection (15 U.S.C. § 78u-6(h)(2)(A))

> _Core Value: Granting the right to anonymity._

This provision states that the SEC shall not disclose information that could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower, unless required by specific laws.
This is the core of our technical architecture. Using **Oasis Sapphire's TEE Privacy Computing** and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**, we achieve the "strict confidentiality" required by law at the bottom layer of technology, even achieving "unknowability at the code level".

#### D. Anonymous Submission Channels (Rule 21F-9(c))

> _Operational Process: Allowing submission by agents._

SEC rules allow whistleblowers to submit information anonymously through lawyers or intermediaries, only needing to disclose their identity when finally claiming the award.
We assign this role to **smart contracts** and the **decentralized network**. Users interact with the network through cryptographic signatures, achieving a direct docking process without intermediaries.

## 2. Living Space under the Judicial Framework

WikiTruth is not a tool to challenge the law, but a **Web3 Digital Upgrade (RegTech)** of judicial procedures.

In the US and major judicial jurisdictions globally, WikiTruth has broad space for survival and development:

1. **Crowdsourced Enforcement**: Regulatory agencies have limited manpower. As a technical crowdsourcing platform, WikiTruth can effectively screen high-value leads and reduce enforcement costs.
2. **Evolution of Evidence**: With the increasing recognition of blockchain deposition (hashes, timestamps) by the judicial system, on-chain evidence provided by WikiTruth will have extremely high legal validity.
3. **First Amendment Protection**: As a technical tool protecting anonymous expression and revealing the truth, WikiTruth's core spirit aligns with the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech.

> **Summary**: WikiTruth is a secure bridge connecting "off-chain facts" and "on-chain evidence", and is the **"Justice Oracle"** of the digital age.
